    <p>NERV is an international organization with their center of operation located in the city of Tokyo-3, Japan. More specifically, they run the majority of their research and operations out of NERV Headquarters, a large facility located in the GeoFront. Outside of their main operation in Japan, NERV also has operations in the United States, Germany and possibly more. </p>

    <p>As far as the world is concerned, NERV is under the control of the United Nations however the truth isn't so simple. In reality, the shadowy organization SEELE are in control of the United Nations and as such, they are also direct overseers to NERV. Despite this oversight, they still mostly operate as an independent organization with SEELE being their main source of funding.</p>

    <p>As an orgnization, it is the successor to Gehirn and therefore the two organizations have a lot in common. Major contributions to NERV from Gehirn include almost all their staff, the incomplete Evangelion units and Project-E and the Magi, three supercomputers which run all of the headquarters, help in critical decision making and also essentially run the Japanese government. Most NERV headquarters around the world have a Magi system with the original being located in Japan. Despite this connected history, in practice NERV functions differently as their main goals and focus more on the application of their technologies to destroy the angels rather then just the development. For this reason, many new staff hired work in combat oriented positions and their headquarters have several security mechanisms to protect from incoming attacks.</p>
